            <h2>The Solar System</h2>

            <img src="solar-system.jpg" class="solar-system-img"  />

            <p>Our solar system is a vast and dynamic collection of celestial objects bound together by the
                gravitational pull of the Sun, a luminous star at its center that provides the energy essential for life
                on Earth. It consists of eight unique planets, each with its own characteristics, ranging from the
                rocky, terrestrial worlds like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars to the massive gas giants Jupiter and
                Saturn, and the icy giants Uranus and Neptune. Surrounding these planets are diverse moons, such as
                Earth's own Moon and Jupiter’s volcanic Io and icy Europa, each with fascinating features and potential
                clues about the universe’s history. Beyond the planets lies the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with icy
                bodies and dwarf planets like Pluto, and the mysterious Oort Cloud, believed to be the source of many
                comets. Our solar system also boasts countless asteroids, meteoroids, and comets, remnants from its
                formation 4.6 billion years ago. Together, these components create a cosmic neighborhood teeming with
                activity, from the intense solar winds shaping planetary atmospheres to the intricate dance of orbits
                governed by gravity. As we continue to explore our solar system through groundbreaking missions and
                telescopic observations, we uncover not only the origins of our celestial home but also insights into
                the greater universe beyond.</p>

            <h3>Sun</h3>

            <div class="planet">

                <img src="sun.jpg" />

                <p>The Sun, the central star of our solar system, is a massive ball of glowing plasma that powers life
                    on Earth and governs the movement of planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. This G-type
                    main-sequence star, or yellow dwarf, is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, undergoing
                    nuclear fusion at its core to produce immense energy in the form of light and heat. With a diameter
                    of about 1.39 million kilometers (865,000 miles) and a mass 330,000 times that of Earth, the Sun
                    accounts for 99.86% of the solar system's total mass, making it the dominant gravitational force.
                    Its visible surface, the photosphere, emits the sunlight that sustains life, while its outer layers,
                    including the dynamic corona, are sites of solar flares and coronal mass ejections that influence
                    space weather and Earth’s magnetosphere. The Sun’s energy drives Earth's climate, supports
                    ecosystems, and fosters life, while its study reveals insights into stellar lifecycles and the
                    workings of the cosmos.</p>

            <h3>Mercury</h3>

            <div class="planet">
                <img src="mercury.jpg" />

                <p>The closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is a small, rocky world known for its extreme temperatures and
                    heavily cratered surface. Its proximity to the Sun means it experiences scorching daytime
                    temperatures of up to 430°C (800°F), while nighttime temperatures plummet to -180°C (-290°F) due to
                    its lack of a significant atmosphere to retain heat. As the smallest planet in the solar system,
                    Mercury is slightly larger than Earth's Moon and shares many of its features, including impact
                    craters and a barren landscape. It has a highly elliptical orbit, causing its speed to vary, making
                    it the fastest-moving planet around the Sun. Despite its proximity to our star, Mercury is difficult
                    to observe from Earth because of its position in the sky, often hidden in the Sun’s glare.</p>

                <img src="venus.jpg" />

                <p>Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is often called Earth’s twin because of its similar size and
                    composition, but its environment is vastly different. Its thick atmosphere, composed mainly of
                    carbon dioxide, creates a runaway greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest planet in the solar
                    system with surface temperatures exceeding 470°C (880°F). The planet is shrouded in dense clouds of
                    sulfuric acid, reflecting sunlight and giving it a bright appearance in our sky, earning it the
                    nickname "Morning Star" or "Evening Star." Venus rotates slowly and in the opposite direction to
                    most planets, causing its day to last longer than its year. Beneath its clouds lies a volcanic and
                    rocky terrain, hinting at a geologically active past.</p>

                <p>Our home planet, Earth, is the third planet from the Sun and the only known world to support life.
                    With a perfect balance of distance from the Sun, a breathable atmosphere, and liquid water covering
                    71% of its surface, Earth provides the ideal conditions for a diverse range of ecosystems to thrive.
                    Its dynamic surface features mountains, oceans, forests, and deserts, shaped over billions of years
                    by tectonic activity, erosion, and climatic processes. Earth’s magnetic field and ozone layer shield
                    it from harmful solar radiation, while its atmosphere sustains life by regulating temperature and
                    providing essential gases. Orbiting the planet is the Moon, whose gravitational influence affects
                    tides and stabilizes Earth’s axial tilt, contributing to its stable climate.</p>

                <p>Known as the "Red Planet" because of its iron oxide-rich surface, Mars is the fourth planet from the
                    Sun and a prime candidate for future human exploration. Its thin atmosphere, primarily composed of
                    carbon dioxide, means the planet experiences cold temperatures, averaging around -60°C (-80°F), and
                    frequent dust storms. Mars features fascinating geological landmarks, including Olympus Mons, the
                    largest volcano in the solar system, and Valles Marineris, a canyon system stretching thousands of
                    kilometers. Evidence of ancient riverbeds and polar ice caps suggests that liquid water once existed
                    on Mars, raising questions about the possibility of past microbial life. Robotic missions have
                    revealed a wealth of information about Mars, fueling humanity's curiosity and plans for
                    colonization.</p>
